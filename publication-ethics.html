                    <li>Authors should provide valid information about themselves. (e.g., valid emails);</li>
                    
                    <li>If the authors have used the work and/or words of others, that should appropriately cited or quoted:
                        <ul>
                            <li>references must reflect a valid state of both the historical development of the subject and the current state of opinion in the field,</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Authors should have all valid permissions for use of information obtained privately and copyrighted materials. (e.g., pictures, diagrams, numerical results);</li>
                    
                    <li>Authors should declare all support and funding sources in an Acknowledgment and if the role of the research funder has been beyond providing funding that should also be described. (e.g., role in study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report);</li>
                    
                    <li>Authors should supply promptly any missing items or information requested by the editors;</li>

                <h2>Peer Review Procedure</h2>
                
                <p>The Editorial Board of the Journal is aware that peer review is the critical phase of the publishing process. All submitted papers are reviewed at least by two experts of which at least one is not part of the editorial staff;</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>In special cases, authors are allowed to nominate two referees in the field (one of the referees must be from abroad);</li>
                    
                    <li>Reviewers should have sufficient subject expertise to evaluate the scientific and practical value of the paper;</li>
                    
                    <li>Reviewers are allowed to consult their colleagues about the paper, but are not allowed to pass on the paper to another referee without notifying the Editor in Chief.</li>
                    
                    <li>If a reviewer is unable to assess the paper, he/she should return or inform the Editor in Chief immediately. His/Her suggestions for alternative referees would be considered.</li>
                    
                    <li>Editor in Chief may appoint new referees because of the reports written superficially without a clear explanation as to why the article should either be accepted or rejected;</li>
                    
                    <li>The average time for evaluation is about two months. However, authors should note that each submission is assessed on its individual merit and in certain circumstances estimating time may differ.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Editorial Board attach high importance to reviewer reports. They should be provided timely and be constructive. These reports should contain concrete arguments referring to the paper which support the decision of the reviewer and not be written in harsh language with insulting expressions or personal attacks;</p>
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reviewers should disqualify themselves from reviewing in cases that they have a very similar manuscript submitted elsewhere in preparation, have conflict of interest with the authors and/or the research fund or they feel that they are unable to provide an honest and unbiased assessment for any reason;</li>
                    
                    <li>Reviewers should keep the submission and contents of manuscripts confidential, they should not contact the authors directly or anyone else about reviewing a manuscript without the knowledge and permission of the journal;</li>
                    
                    <li>Reviewers are not allowed to use author's manuscript in their researches without permission from the author and should destroy copies of manuscripts after submitting their reviews;</li>
                    
                    <li>Reviewers should notify journals in case of any suspicion of misconduct such as possible data fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, image manipulation, unethical research, biased reporting, authorship abuse, redundant or duplicate publication, and undeclared conflicts of interest.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If all the reviewers' reports are positive the paper will be accepted for publication. However, when at least one of the reports is negative, then the manuscript will be sent out to a different referee. If the report of this reviewer also is negative, then the paper will be rejected. In the case when the second report is positive, the manuscript will be sent to the Editor in Chief for ultimate decision;</p>
